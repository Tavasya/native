# Redo Assignment Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added "Redo Assignment" buttons to all submission feedback pages, allowing users to quickly start a new attempt directly from their results/feedback pages.

## Components Enhanced

### 1. **FeedbackHeader.tsx** ✨ ENHANCED
**Location:** `/src/components/student/feedback/FeedbackHeader.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `showRedoButton`, `onRedo`, and `assignmentId` props
- Added redo button with RefreshCw icon in top-right header area
- Button appears between "Back" and "Submit & Send" buttons

**New Interface:**
```typescript
interface FeedbackHeaderProps {
  // ... existing props
  assignmentId?: string;
  showRedoButton?: boolean;
  onRedo?: () => void;
}
```

### 2. **PendingSubmission.tsx** ✨ ENHANCED  
**Location:** `/src/components/student/PendingSubmission.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added redo button in header section (top-right)
- Integrated with Redux to create new in-progress submissions
- Added loading state with spinning icon during attempt creation
- Auto-navigates to practice page after successful attempt creation

**New Features:**
- `handleRedoAssignment()` - Creates new attempt and navigates to practice
- Loading state management with `isCreatingNewAttempt`
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback

### 3. **SubmissionFeedback.tsx** ✨ ENHANCED
**Location:** `/src/pages/student/SubmissionFeedback.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added redo functionality to the main feedback page
- Integrated Redux dispatch and navigation
- Enhanced FeedbackHeader with redo props
- Role-based redo button visibility (students only)

**New Features:**
- `handleRedoAssignment()` - Creates new attempt via Redux
- Enhanced header calls with redo parameters
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 4. **SubmissionResults.tsx** ✨ ENHANCED
**Location:** `/src/components/SubmissionResults.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced existing "Retry Assignment" button
- Replaced simple navigation with proper Redux submission creation
- Added loading states and better error handling
- Integrated with existing resubmission flow

**Improvements:**
- Uses `createInProgressSubmission` thunk instead of direct navigation
- Loading state with disabled button during attempt creation
- Toast notifications for better UX

## User Experience Flow

### From Pending Submission Page:
1. User sees "Redo Assignment" button in top-right header
2. Click → Creates new in-progress submission
3. Auto-navigates to practice page
4. User can start recording immediately

### From Feedback/Results Pages:
1. User sees "Redo Assignment" button in header area
2. Click → Creates new in-progress submission  
3. Shows loading state with "Starting New Attempt..."
4. Auto-navigates to practice page
5. User bypasses resubmission modal (since they intentionally chose to redo)

### From Results Page:
1. Enhanced existing "Retry Assignment" button at bottom
2. Same flow as above with improved Redux integration

## Technical Implementation

### Redux Integration:
- Uses `createInProgressSubmission` thunk
- Proper attempt number calculation
- Status management (in_progress)

### Navigation:
- Direct navigation to `/student/practice/${assignmentId}`
- No modal interruption (user already chose to redo)

### Error Handling:
- Toast notifications for success/error states
- Loading states during async operations
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

### Button States:
- **Normal:** "Redo Assignment" with RefreshCw icon
- **Loading:** "Starting New Attempt..." with spinning icon
- **Disabled:** During attempt creation to prevent double-clicks

## Locations of Redo Buttons

1. **Pending Submissions** → Top-right header
2. **Detailed Feedback Page** → Top-right header  
3. **Results Page** → Top-right header + bottom retry button
4. **Waiting for Report** → Top-right header

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent UX** - Redo button available wherever users view their submissions

✅ **Quick Access** - No need to navigate back to dashboard → assignments → practice

✅ **Proper Flow** - Creates submissions correctly with attempt tracking

✅ **Loading States** - Clear feedback during async operations

✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation with helpful error messages

The implementation provides a seamless way for users to quickly restart assignments from any feedback page, improving the overall user experience and reducing navigation friction.
