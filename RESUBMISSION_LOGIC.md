# Resubmission Logic Implementation

## Status-Based Flow Logic

### When User Visits Practice Page

1. **System checks for existing submissions** for the user + assignment
2. **Logic branches based on submission status:**

#### ✅ **No Existing Submission**
- User proceeds directly to practice
- No modal shown

#### ✅ **Existing Submission with `in_progress` Status**  
- User proceeds directly to practice 
- Can continue where they left off
- **No modal shown** (this was the key fix!)

#### ✅ **Existing Submission with Completed Status**
- `pending` - Submitted, waiting for analysis
- `awaiting_review` - Under teacher review  
- `graded` - Completed and graded
- **Modal shown** with options to view results or start new attempt

### Modal Behavior

The `ResubmissionChoiceModal` only appears for **completed submissions**, giving users:

1. **View Submission & Results** - Navigate to results page
2. **Start New Attempt** - Create new in_progress submission

### Status Handling in Code

```typescript
// In checkExistingSubmission thunk:
if (latestSubmission.status === 'in_progress') {
    console.log("Submission is in progress - allowing user to continue");
    return null; // Don't show modal
}

if (['pending', 'awaiting_review', 'graded'].includes(latestSubmission.status)) {
    console.log("Submission is completed - showing choice modal");
    return normalizedSubmission; // Show modal
}
```

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: First Time User
- No existing submission → Direct to practice

### Scenario 2: User with In-Progress Assignment  
- Has `in_progress` submission → Continue practicing (no interruption)

### Scenario 3: User with Completed Assignment
- Has completed submission → Modal offers choice to view results or redo

### Scenario 4: User Chooses New Attempt
- Creates new `in_progress` submission with incremented attempt number
- User can immediately start practicing

## Key Benefits

- **No interruption** for users continuing in-progress work
- **Clear choice** for users with completed submissions  
- **Proper attempt tracking** for multiple submission attempts
- **Status-aware UI** that adapts to submission state
